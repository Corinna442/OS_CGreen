1. Command to make a directory named `DirA`: mkdir DirA
3. Command to make a directory named `Dir B`: mkdir Dir B

5. Is `DirA` or `Dir B` a better name?  Defend: 'DirA' is better. 'Dir B' has a space that can make accessing files more complicated. Further, a space separates a command, so this would be an issue.
